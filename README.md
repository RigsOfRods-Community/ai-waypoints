Once done, press the `Start` button to test the path. Finally click the `Waypoints` header and press the `Export` button. A notififation will appear and the waypoints will be saved in `RoR.log`.

Open an issue in this repository and provide the terrain name, desired preset name and waypoints list. Pull requests are welcomed also, the json file is very simple structured.

# Load local file
Put `waypoints.json` file inside `Documents\My Games\Rigs of Rods\savegames` on Windows or `~/.rigsofrods/savegames` on Linux. Rigs of Rods will load that instead of fetching from github.
